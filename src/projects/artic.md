Artic is a fully responsive and modern blog/magazine template built with **Next.js**, designed to
cater to content creators, news platforms, and online publications. This template offers a sleek
and user-friendly interface with a focus on customization and functionality.

Key features:

* **Dark/Light Theme:** Seamless theme switching for enhanced user experience.
* **Advanced Search & Filters:** Robust search functionality with filtering options for categories and tags.
* **Dynamic Content Organization:** Easily categorize and tag posts for better content discoverability.
* **Responsive Design:** Optimized for all devices, ensuring a smooth experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
* **Modern UI/UX:** Clean and intuitive design tailored for readability and engagement.

This project was initially developed as a premium template for sale. However, it was not accepted by
certain template marketplaces due to their specific guidelines or requirements. Despite this, Artic
remains a showcase of my expertise in front-end development, Next.js, and creating reusable, modular
components. It’s a testament to my ability to build scalable, feature-rich web applications with a
focus on user experience.
