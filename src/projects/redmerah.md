Redmerah is a comprehensive web application designed to bring together a suite of powerful tools
into one efficient and user-friendly platform. From an advanced calculator and todo tasks to a color
maker, gradient generator, QR code reader/scanner, randomizer, and more, Redmerah simplifies
everyday tasks without the clutter and frustrations of traditional apps.

Frustrated with apps that charge fees for basic features, overwhelm users with ads, or have clunky
interfaces, I built Redmerah to be different: **fast**, **intuitive**, and
**free of unnecessary distractions**.

Key features:

* **Local-First Approach:** All data is stored and processed locally in your browser using the
  IndexedDB API, ensuring lightning-fast performance and enhanced privacy. No server-side operations
  mean no delays or constant page reloads.
* **Handcrafted UI:** Every component is custom-built by me using *Astro* and *SolidJS*, with no
  reliance on third-party libraries. This results in a seamless, lightweight, and highly intuitive
  user experience.
* **Versatile Tools:** A growing collection of utilities, including:
  * Advanced calculator
  * TODO Tasks
  * Color maker, picker, and gradient generator
  * QR code reader/scanner
  * Randomizer
  * And much more!

Redmerah is a testament to my passion for creating efficient, user-centric applications that
prioritize performance, privacy, and simplicity. It’s a project born out of the desire to solve
real-world problems and provide a better alternative to bloated, ad-ridden tools.
