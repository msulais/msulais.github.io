<p>Artic is a fully responsive and modern blog/magazine template built with <strong>Next.js</strong>, designed to
    cater to content creators, news platforms, and online publications. This template offers a sleek
    and user-friendly interface with a focus on customization and functionality.</p>
<p>Key features:</p>
<ul>

    <li><strong>Advanced Search &amp; Filters:</strong> Robust search functionality with filtering options for categories and tags.</li>
    <li><strong>Dynamic Content Organization:</strong> Easily categorize and tag posts for better content discoverability.</li>

<p>This project was initially developed as a premium template for sale. However, it was not accepted by
    certain template marketplaces due to their specific guidelines or requirements. Despite this, Artic
    remains a showcase of my expertise in front-end development, Next.js, and creating reusable, modular
    components. It’s a testament to my ability to build scalable, feature-rich web applications with a
    focus on user experience.</p>
