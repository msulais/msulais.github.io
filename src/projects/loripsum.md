A Figma plugin designed to generate truly randomized placeholder text.

I built this plugin to solve a specific frustration I encountered during design work: the repetitive
nature of existing text generators. While most tools output the standard Latin sequence ("*Lorem*
*ipsum dolor sit amet...*") in the exact same order every time, my plugin implements a randomization
algorithm to create unique text variations every time.

**Key Features:**

* **True Randomization:** Never get the same text sequence twice.
* **Granular Control:** Generate specific amounts of Words, Sentences, or Paragraphs.
* **Text Styling:** Automatically apply Sentence Case (Capitalize), UPPERCASE, or lowercase formatting.
